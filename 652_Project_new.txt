************************
Expectations:
************************
1. Significant new software development
2. Some value addition
3. Can modify existing code
4. Protocol Design Development/ Enhancement
5. Some novelty
6. Improve existing literature
7. Any layer (Link layer, Network layer
Transport, Application layer)
8. Evaluation and Results (Simulation in Cooja)
Preferably on real motes
Test bed: Tmote hardware

*************************
Sample Ideas
*************************
1. Multicast Routing - CTP, BCP, RPL 
 - Start with an existing piece of code to implement this functionality
2. Link Layer
 - Adaptive CSMA mechanism
3. Transport Layer
 - Enhancement to TCP implemented in Contiki
Protocols suited for mobile environments
 - Mobile Ad-hoc networks
 - Sparse intermittently connected nodes
Application layer protocols for mobile environment 
 - Store and Forward/ Publish - Subscribe network
 - Data centric networking
   COntent more important than address
   Efficient dessimination of information
Low power primitives
Enabling options for higher level layers by using functionalities provided by lower layers
Balance recent and old papers -2002 onwards
